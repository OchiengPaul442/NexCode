## Iteration 0 — Bootstrap

**Date:** 20 July 2026  
**Finding IDs:** N/A (bootstrap — no production findings fixed)  
**Commit:** `6c10ab9` — `chore(remediation): initialize verified work queue`

### What was done

1. Read the complete CodeRabbit-style audit (NEXCODE_FULL_CODERABBIT_STYLE_REVIEW.md, 1279 lines, 45 NC findings).
2. Read the remediation prompt (NEXCODE_CLAUDE_OPENCODE_REMEDIATION_PROMPT.md).
3. Verified working tree was clean (`git status` — no uncommitted changes).
4. Created `docs/remediation/WORK_QUEUE.md` with all 45 NC findings:
   - P0 Critical: NC-001 through NC-008 (8 findings)
   - P1 High: NC-009 through NC-028 (20 findings)
   - P2 Medium: NC-029 through NC-045 (17 findings)
   - Each finding includes: severity, status (pending), phase assignment, dependencies, affected files/symbols, verified status, required tests, verification commands, and resolution evidence placeholder.
   - Dependency graph and execution order provided.
5. Updated `docs/remediation/STATE.json`:
   - `bootstrapRequired`: false
   - `status`: in_progress
   - `iteration`: 0
   - Counts: 45 pending, 0 in-progress, 0 fixed, 0 blocked, 0 obsolete, 0 false-positive
6. Committed bootstrap documents (no production source modified).
